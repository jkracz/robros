## 🔍 Features 🔍

- **Searchability**: As you type in the search bar, the directory automatically filters to match your query. Finding your robot friend is just a keystroke away!
- **Unique Robot Profiles**: Each robot friend is unique. RoBros utilizes data from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and generates a unique robot image for each friend using [Robohash](https://robohash.org/).
